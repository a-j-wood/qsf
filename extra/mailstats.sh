# Script to rotate procmail.log (appends it, gzip-compressed, to
# procmail.log.old.gz). New data is converted to SQL INSERT statements and
# inserted into a MySQL table.
#
# Note that this script requires GNU `date', `awk', and `sed'. It also needs
# the MySQL command-line client, `mysql'. It may need to run under bash,
# rather than Bourne shell, too; this has not been tested.
#
# The spam log table has two fields, "stamp" and "type". "stamp" is the date
# and time of the email, and "type" is the type of email:
#
#   SPAM              Message was flagged as spam and a bounce sent by JMBA.
#   SPAM-BOUNCE       A bounce sent by JMBA was returned as undeliverable.
#   SPAM-REPLY        A bounce sent by JMBA was replied to.
#   DELIVERED         The email was delivered normally.
#   RETRAIN-SPAM      User retraining QSF - message was really spam.
#   RETRAIN-NONSPAM   User retraining QSF - message was really non-spam.
#
# The procmail.log file is expected in $LOGDIR (defined below), and it
# should be generated by adding this to the top of your .procmailrc file:
#
#   LOGFILE=$HOME/procmail.log
#   LOGABSTRACT=yes
#
# (replace $HOME/ with whatever you set $LOGDIR to below).
#
# For this script to be able to tell what options you called JMBA and QSF
# with, be sure to put the action options first (i.e. "jmba -b ..." instead
# of "jmba ... -b", "jmba -s ..." not "jmba ... -s", and "qsf -M ..." rather
# than "qsf -d foo -g bar -g baz -a -M").
#
# You will need a table in database $MYSQLDB called $MYSQLTABLE (default is
# "spamlog"). The following schema will do:
#
#   CREATE TABLE `spamlog` (
#     `stamp` TIMESTAMP(14) NOT NULL,
#     `type`  ENUM('SPAM','SPAM-BOUNCE','SPAM-REPLY','DELIVERED',
#                  'RETRAIN-SPAM','RETRAIN-NONSPAM')
#             NOT NULL DEFAULT 'DELIVERED',
#     KEY (`stamp`),
#     KEY (`type`)
#   );
#
# If you run this script regularly (say, once a day) from cron, you can then
# do SQL queries on that table to get a picture of your spam blocking.
#
# Fill in the MYSQL* and LOGDIR variables below to make this script work.
