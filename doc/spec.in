%description
Quick Spam Filter (@PACKAGE@) is a small, fast spam filter that works by
learning to recognise the words that are more likely to appear in spam than
non-spam.  It is intended to be used in a procmail recipe to mark email as
being possible spam.

Available rpmbuild rebuild options:
  --without: gdbm mysql sqlite
     --with: static
